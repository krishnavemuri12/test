Your scenario involves processing multiple pipelines in a Jenkins build, and you want to handle the following case:

One pipeline fails at a certain stage, and you'd like to retry that pipeline from scratch.
Hold the other pipelines at their current stage until the failed one is retried and catches up.
Once the failed pipeline catches up, allow all pipelines to continue processing from where they left off.
Is This Possible in Jenkins?
Yes, conceptually this is possible, but technically, it’s quite complex in Jenkins due to the way Jenkins processes builds. The default behavior of Jenkins (in a declarative pipeline or scripted pipeline) is to halt the entire build if any step fails, unless you implement specific strategies to handle errors.

Let’s break this down and explain how you might attempt to implement it, and then go over some limitations you will encounter:

1. Retry Failed Pipeline From Scratch
Retrying a failed pipeline from the beginning when it fails is absolutely possible. Jenkins provides mechanisms like retry() blocks and catchError() to retry failed stages.

2. Holding Other Pipelines at Their Stage
Here’s where things get tricky. Jenkins doesn’t inherently support a "hold" or "pause" functionality for specific pipelines while continuing with others. Jenkins pipelines, once they start executing, either complete or fail. To "pause" a pipeline at a stage and wait for another pipeline to catch up is not a feature that is natively supported in Jenkins.

3. Resuming Once the Failed Pipeline Catches Up
If you managed to hold the pipelines somehow, resuming them once the failed one catches up would be another complex mechanism to implement. You'd need to track the state of all pipelines and check when the failed one is back on track.

Technical Challenges:
Parallelization: Jenkins processes pipelines linearly unless explicitly set to execute stages in parallel. However, managing stages in parallel and holding one while others continue is complicated.

Global Pipeline State: Each pipeline runs in its own scope within a Jenkins build, so tracking stages across pipelines and controlling execution flow dynamically across multiple pipelines is hard.

Possible Approaches to Solve This:
Option 1: Implement a Sequential Retry Mechanism
In this approach, you would process each pipeline one by one. If one pipeline fails, you would retry it from scratch while holding off the others.

Implementation:
Process each pipeline sequentially (not in parallel).
If a failure occurs, retry the failed pipeline from scratch using a loop with retry().
Once the failed pipeline finishes successfully, proceed to the next one.
Limitations: You cannot parallelize pipelines in this case, and every pipeline waits for the previous one to finish completely (whether failed or not).
Option 2: Implement Parallel Processing with State Tracking and Retry
This is the closest approach to what you’re asking for, but it is far more complex to implement. The idea here is to:

Track the state of each pipeline: Keep a global record of which stage each pipeline is in.
Retry failed pipelines from scratch: If one pipeline fails, retry it from the beginning while holding the others at their current stage.
Resume other pipelines once the failed one has caught up.
This would involve:

Parallel Stages: Use Jenkins’ parallel directive to process multiple pipelines simultaneously.
State Tracking: Use a shared map (like pipelineResults) to track the state of each pipeline.
Holding Mechanism: Use something like waitUntil() in each pipeline to pause at a particular stage if a failure occurs.
Retry Failed Pipelines: Use retry() or a custom retry mechanism to handle failed pipelines.
However, this approach is extremely difficult to manage in Jenkins, especially with parallel stages and shared state across pipelines. Jenkins does not natively support this kind of complex orchestration, so implementing this would require significant custom scripting.

Why This Is Challenging in Jenkins:
No Native Hold Mechanism: Jenkins pipelines cannot "pause" dynamically. Pipelines either run or fail; there's no built-in way to halt at a stage and wait for another pipeline to complete.

Parallel Execution Management: If you use the parallel directive, all pipelines will execute independently. You would have to build your own mechanism to check whether one pipeline has caught up to others.

Handling Failure and Resume: Jenkins typically treats failures as terminal unless you handle them manually. You would have to create custom retry and resume logic.

Example of a Sequential Retry Approach (Option 1):
Here’s how you might implement a simple sequential retry mechanism without holding other pipelines:

groovy
Copy code
def pipelineResults = [:]

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Process Pipelines') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def pipelines = params.PIPELINE_LIST.split("\n")
                    
                    // Process each pipeline sequentially
                    pipelines.each { pipeline ->
                        retryPipeline(pipeline) // Retry this pipeline until successful
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

def retryPipeline(pipeline) {
    retry(3) {  // Retry the entire pipeline up to 3 times
        script {
            echo "Processing pipeline: ${pipeline}"
            pipelineResults[pipeline] = [:]  // Initialize result for the pipeline

            try {
                // Simulate stages
                unpublishNPE(pipeline)
                publishNPE(pipeline)
                unpublishUAT(pipeline)
                promoteNPEtoUAT(pipeline)
                publishUAT(pipeline)
                
                // If successful, record success
                pipelineResults[pipeline]["status"] = "PASS"

            } catch (Exception e) {
                echo "Error processing pipeline ${pipeline}: ${e.message}"
                pipelineResults[pipeline]["status"] = "FAIL"
                throw e  // Fail the pipeline and trigger retry
            }
        }
    }
}

def unpublishNPE(pipeline) {
    // Simulate unpublishing logic in NPE
    echo "Unpublishing ${pipeline} in NPE"
}

def publishNPE(pipeline) {
    // Simulate publishing logic in NPE
    echo "Publishing ${pipeline} in NPE"
}

def unpublishUAT(pipeline) {
    // Simulate unpublishing logic in UAT
    echo "Unpublishing ${pipeline} in UAT"
}

def promoteNPEtoUAT(pipeline) {
    // Simulate promoting logic from NPE to UAT
    echo "Promoting ${pipeline} from NPE to UAT"
}

def publishUAT(pipeline) {
    // Simulate publishing logic in UAT
    echo "Publishing ${pipeline} in UAT"
}
Key Points:
This approach retries each pipeline sequentially until it succeeds or reaches the retry limit (in this case, 3 retries).
If a pipeline fails, it retries from the beginning.
Other pipelines do not progress until the failed one completes successfully.
Conclusion:
Pausing pipelines at specific stages while waiting for a failed one to catch up is not natively supported in Jenkins and is quite complex to implement.
Retrying failed pipelines from the beginning while processing pipelines sequentially is straightforward and can be done using retry() blocks or custom retry logic.
If your goal is to pause and resume pipelines dynamically, you might need to look into a more sophisticated orchestration tool like Kubernetes or Airflow, which supports dynamic task management and parallelism more effectively.
